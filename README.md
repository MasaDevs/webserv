# HTTP Server Project

## Overview
This project revolves around the creation of a custom HTTP server from scratch. The server has been meticulously crafted using the C++ 98 standard, shedding light on the intricacies and details of the HTTP protocol.

## Inspiration
Our server is inspired by the widely acclaimed web server software: `nginx`. Like `nginx`, our server handles HTTP requests and responses, showcasing a deep-rooted understanding of the HTTP protocol.

## Key Features
- Developed using the C++ 98 standard.
- Comprehensive interpretation of HTTP requests and responses.
- Capability to serve both static and dynamic web pages.
- Robust error handling based on HTTP status codes.

## Resources
During the development of this server, the following resources were indispensable for a comprehensive understanding of the HTTP protocol:

- [Mozilla Developer Network's HTTP Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)
- [HTTP Specifications by HTTPWG](https://httpwg.org/specs/)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the C++ code using a C++ 98 compliant compiler.
3. Run the server and access it using any HTTP client or web browser.
